# Windows Optimization Pack

Welcome to the **Windows Optimization Pack**! This repository contains various tweaks and scripts that I use to optimize my PC's performance. Be cautious when executing any of these scripts, as they may potentially break your system. **Always ensure you understand what you're running!**

### Disclaimer
Some of these tweaks are more than a year old, and I may have forgotten their original sources. If you find your work included without proper credit, feel free to reach out, and I'll gladly update the credits section.

### Contributions
If you have any optimizations, tips, or scripts you believe are worth sharing, don’t hesitate to contribute! We're always open to new ideas that can benefit the community.

### Credits
All current credits can be found in the [**creds_for_pack.txt**](./creds_for_pack.txt) file. If I missed anyone, let me know, and I’ll update it as soon as possible.
